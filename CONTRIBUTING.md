## Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! This guide explains how to contribute effectively.

### Development workflow
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Make focused changes with clear commit messages.
- Add/update documentation in `docs/` if behavior changes.
- Open a Merge Request/PR with a concise description and testing notes.

### Code style
- Keep comments in English.
- Prefer small, well-named procedures and centralized constants in `DATA.ASM`.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in the same change.

### Documentation
- Keep teacher-required docs up to date in `docs/`.
- Update screenshots in `assets/images/captures/` and diagrams in `assets/images/diagrams/`.

### Versioning
- Use Git tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) for releases instead of duplicating sources under `versions/`.
- Optionally create a `release/*` branch for presentation builds.

### Reporting issues
Please include:
- Steps to reproduce (or screenshots)
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment (DOSBox-X version, assembler)
